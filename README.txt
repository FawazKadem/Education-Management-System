CS 2212 Final

Every method works and handles common exceptions. If there are errors, there is a chance it has
something to with the project transfer. Please feel free to reach out at fmoham26@uwo.ca
if you need anything from our group. SDD is included in zip file.

Testing settings: Project imported into Intellij

Input files (included) are note_1.txt and note_2.txt

Two jar files need to be loaded: commons-lang3-3.0 and javax.mail-api-1.4.7 (located in jarfiles_dep folder)

We use an email server hosted on localhost to set passwords and send notifications.
Since this server is hosted on localhost, we have commented it out since we wouldn't want to run a server on
your computer without your permission. It also can cause errors depending on your network.
To turn this server on, please visit the SendEmail class in systemOperations to set the default recipient and 
change the emailOn boolean to true. 

Thank you
